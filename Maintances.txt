Try visualise a team of employees that work in startup and set a IAM role with proper policies for every position that needs to have access to development, testing or deployment environments.


So I can share the list of possible people that might need access like:

DB, server-side, client side, security auditor, Devops, CEO, CTO, SEO specialist and more…

Most of these people will need to have their own role with specific policies attached for each of them. 

I understand that we create one role with policies other might needs more or less but at least we have very good base


Are you able to help create those roles and describe each role what they expected to do from your experience 


You might want to use this to remind you what positions are out there so you can create their roles with proper policies
